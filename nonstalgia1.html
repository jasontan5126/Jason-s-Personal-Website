Surprisingly I still have the first Iphone devices which Apple has discontinued selling but I don't know if they still work since I haven't use it for years. Back when I used it, I was mainly focused on games (Angry Birds Seasons, Doodle Jump, etc) that were included in the first Iphone since my Internet back then was shitty. Also those icons apps on the home screen are so memorable which aren't on the modern Iphones today. I'll never forget that day which that moment may never occur again. </span>

I was so addicted to it that I would smuggle it on a school bus when on my way to elementary school or home to entertain myself with fun.
