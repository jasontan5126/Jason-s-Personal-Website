            It's been a long time using this version on the computer I used to
            have before switching to Vista and Windows 7. Also its sound effects
            are so memorable and nonstalgic to me especially the games such as
            Space cadet Pinball. Too bad most computers in stores unfortunately
            don't feature Windows XP since Windows 10 is currently used. Also I

            don't know if they still work since I haven't use it for years. Back
            when I used it, I was mainly focused on games (Angry Birds Seasons,
            Doodle Jump, etc) that were included in the first Iphone since my
            Internet back then was shitty. Also those icons apps on the home
            screen are so memorable which aren't on the modern Iphones today.

            remember the AOL sound features (send message, receive message)
            since I used to see one of my family relative use AOL for personal
            purposes. Unfortunately AOL no longer exist today as a messeaging
            app which I will truly miss its nonstalgic features. I blame the
            rise in social media such as Instagram, Facebook, etc for the
            decline in popularity of AOL Instant Messenger.
