    <div class="myThought">
      <p>
        Today officially marks the final day of July. I can't believe it's
        already going to be August tomorrow and this summer is flying by really
        fast as my fall semester starts in 3 weeks. While I had those in mind, I
        also enjoyed the Google Doodle game
        <b> (Google Doodle Champion Island Games) </b> that was featured on
        Google Homepage this week. I will tell more in detail about why I found
        it interesting and unique to play and how I found out about it.
        <br /><br />

        So here I was on Wednesday sitting at my cubicle during my summer
        internship doing what I'm supposed to do (Assisting on the Coding
        Project(s)). So until I clicked on the "New Tab" button on Chrome, I
        realized that the usual Google icon was replaced with the Google Doodle
        icon with the Doodle game that I can play. I initially thought, "Is this
        a joke because I rarely see Google Doodle icons that feature a game that
        I can play on Google homescreen?" Until I played it, I found the intro
        cutscene and graphic to be really good which eventually led me towards
        playing that fun doodle game for almost the whole day. Plus it was my
        flashback in which I used to play these 16 bit games on my old Gameboy
        as a child (Good old Days!). Plus it felt almost similar to playing
        Pokemon on a video game console. <br /><br />

        After I got the experience of playing the doodle game being featured on
        Google, I decided, "Why don't I record myself playing and completing the
        entire game Thursday night before it disappears from Google homescreen
        in remembrance of all fun games I enjoyed playing?" So pretty much, it
        took me Thursday and Friday night (7/29-7/30) to make a complete video
        walkthrough of me completing the main quest and side quests for this
        game. <br /><br />

        Essentially the game was enjoyable to play especially since I'm
        controlling the main character who is a cat named Lucky. I found her
        appearance to be really cute and the creators really did a good job
        creating this game. It's not often that I see Google release a new
        stylish icon which features a game I can play just for fun. If you guys
        are interested, you can find the recorded video of myself actually
        playing and beating the entire game if bored. I will always keep that
        recorded video in remembrance of that enjoyable game I played. Enjoy!
