    <div class="myThought">
      <p>
        It is officially now one year since I've been at home since COVID
        started. And COVID really has taken the toll for me to develop long
        lasting relationships with new people. <br /><br />
        There are times where I've tried attending club events (mainly cultural
        clubs) mainly because I felt most people were cool/interesting to
        interact with. However, every time I attend club events/socials, there
        might be times where everybody including myself just exchanges their
        social media profiles to get in touch. And next thing that happens is I
        barely get any replies/messages almost like if I was never born or
        existent. <br />
        <br />
        As fall semester comes closer and classes will be in person for me
        (FINALLY!!! After being online for at least a year), I've already
        started setting goals toward hopefully making strong friendships:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <br />
        <li>Definitely attend the SBU Fall 2021 Involvement Fair <b></b></li>
        <li>
          Try attending club events with hope that it doesn't conflict with
          class time <b></b>
        </li>
        <li>Try to spend time with people outside of clubs</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>
        I've even got to connect with some incoming freshman (SBU 2025) through
        social media (Instagram). Some of them
        <b>(THEIR IDENTITIES WILL NOT BE RELEASED)</b>, I've developed a strong
        connection mainly because we both had something in common. Which is why
        I want to actually meet them in person this fall just so we can enjoy
        spending time together.<br />
        <br />

        Making friends during COVID is probably the hardest thing I've tried to
        accomplished. Even if I become friends with those I don't know well, I
        will eventually lose connections with them in which as a result, I can't
        treat them as my true friends. It's obvious especially if they don't
        network with me frequently after introducing myself for first time. I've
        even tried the SBU blind dating on reddit but it doesn't seem to help me
        develop new connections with new people. I'm hoping that this fall, I
        will develop long lasting friendships as I meet new people in clubs plus
        my old friends I've befriend during my undergraduate years.
