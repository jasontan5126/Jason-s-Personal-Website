    <div class="myThought">
      <p>
        As one week has passed by since my 21st birthday, life feels so
        different now that I am an adult in contrast to me as a child. In my
        experience, time has gone by pretty fast every year and there is no sign
        that it may slow as soon as I approach myself as an elder years from
        now. <br /><br />
        However, being 21 has gone into a great start for me because I attended
        my first in person event ever since before COVID started. One of them
        was when I volunteered to help in preparation for the NYC triathlon
        after viewing it in the "CKI Gen-Bod 21-20" discord announcements. The
        reason I took advantage of this opportunity was to actually meet new
        people (hopefully at least one Stony Brook student) in person after
        spending time in remote for at least a year since COVID started.
        <br /><br />

        To be honest, it was enjoyable and worth attending as I got to make some
        new friends that I've never met before. Most of them were from City
        College. Their names were
        <b>Abdullah, Yussef, Kelly, and Jessin. </b> We were together shaded a
        tent this whole day where we distributed accessories to participants for
        tomorrow's triathlon which was how I got to know them better. I
        especially got a chance to talk with Abdullah and Yussef a lot since we
        were together helping each other in the volunteer work. What we would
        talk about was our college experience, our daily life, and etc. Until
        suddenly, Kelly told me that there was a volunteer from SBU which turned
        out to be <b>Jessin</b>.<br /><br />
        For some reason me and Jessin were pretty excited with meeting each
        other mainly because we hadn't met an SBU student in person for quite a
        while. We actually chilled out eating dinner while engaging in a nice
        conversation regarding life, school, etc. Somehow, she knew me because I
        attended the Francis Lewis Key Club Summer Social through Zoom. Anyhow I
        asked a question regarding her interest of being adding her to my
        mosaic. Somehow, she was pretty impressed with my idea of making a
        mosaic of my friends as part of web. Therefore, she expressed interest
        into being added by sending me a pic of herself through Discord.
        <br /><br />

        After a long conversation with <b>Jessin</b> during dinner, our
        relationship grew unexpectingly especially when we talked continuously
        on our way home through subway late at night. I was even asked if
        someday during this upcoming fall semester, we can workout together in
        the SBU recreation center and I said "Yeah!" But I'll see what happens
        closer to this upcoming fall. As of now and most likely the future, I
        continue to keep in touch with <b>Jessin</b> through Discord whenever.
        <br /><br />

        Looking back to my first week being 21, I think choosing to volunteer
        for the NYC triathlon was a good decision because I got a chance to make
        new friends in person in a while than through remote events. Although I
        wished I got to talk to the Key clubbers, they didn't look too
        interested into talking with Circle K'ers (college students). As I
        always say, it's never too late to continue the objective of making new
        friends or even developing a strong bond.
