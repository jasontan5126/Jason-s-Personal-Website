        <p>
          As one week since my 21st birthday has gone by, life for me as an adult feels so different compared to when I was a child and a teenager. Who would have thought that my 21 years has gone by quick because there are good moments in life which I may never experience again. For example, when I was a kid, I used to play a lot of video games mainly on my Nintendo DS, PSP, and Nintendo Wii.
          Because I was addicted to video games, I didn't know about how to take care of myself, act maturely, how to respond to real-life situations, and etc. Currently, I've forced myself ever since high school to act mature, be ready to respond to our daily life situations, and etc because there will never be a time where I will act as a child forever. This would eventually be the moment where I abandoned
          my childish habits of what I'd used to do because it was dragging me to a borderline in which I didn't act like an adult as I should be. <br><br> Although currrently I'm meeting the standards of what is expected as an adult, there are certain aspects or traits that I still want to improve on. One of the big things that I strive to improve is the idea of interacting with new people. The reason is some
          people are nice while some are not interested into wanting to know me better. However, there is no stopping for me even though I am usually an interoverted or shy person because I tend to overcome that obstacle by putting confidence on myself when speaking to new people. And I will continue to improve every time I try to meet new people/friends.
