     <p><br>Cyberchase 
      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This is my favorite childhood show out of all the PBS Kids shows mainly because of the adventures the Cybersquad does to stop The Hacker from taking over Cyberspace. Also the For Real segment would air after the episode ended with Harry or Bianca starring the show. During my childhood I remember it airing at 4:30pm after I came back from elementary school because I was excited to see which episode would air. Good old days!</span>

     <p><br>Mister Roger's Neighborhood 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I remember watching this as a kid on PBS Kids. This was probably the show that would help cure my depression when I was a child since I didn't had too many friends during that time. The opening for the music was what was catchy to making me watch this show since it was more relaxed. I find this better than the show: Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood in my opinion.</span>

     <p><br>Curious George 
      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This was also a good show that I used to watch as a kid mainly because it stars the monkey and The Man with the Yellow Hat. I don't have too much to say about this show other than that I watched it frequently on television as a kid.</span>

     <p><br>Bill Nye the Science Guy 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">OMG! I remember this series whenever in science class at elementary school, my former teacher would pull up this show for our entire class to watch to educate us about science. The reason why I loved it was the idea that I wasn't just listening to plain old information to make me fall asleep, but I saw some drama and some cool experiments that would be performed by the main show host. I missed watching this show. Also the opening for each episode was pretty catchy.</span>

     <p><br>Between the Lions 
      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I found this show to be pretty educational when I watched it mainly because it taught you mostly about phonics and pronounciation. I don't remember too much about this show but the opening and credit ending song was pretty catchy. </span>

     <p><br>Indiana Jones (franchise) 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I remember first watching this show in middle school and I found it to be a really good franchise series after playing Lego Indiana Jones as a kid especially Harrison Ford who really did a good job acting as Indiana Jones. The first three films are probably my favorite which were made in the 1980s</span>

     <p><br>The Mysteries of Alfred Hedgehog 
      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This show was my absolute favorite mainly because I was interested in the idea that the three main characters are actually solving mysteries of weird and different occurances that occur in each episode. Also I used to watched the full credits for each episode mainly to learn new facts about the foucsed mystery that was solved. Note that I watched it on qubo channel as a kid.</span>

     <p><br>Are you Afraid of the Dark 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This 1990s series was pretty good and scary when I watched it. I didn't watch all the episodes for this show since some of the other episodes were pretty scary with the supernatural occurrances. The only time I watched it was in middle school during free time. If you are brave enough, watch all the episodes and see if this show is scary to you.</span>

     <p><br>Pokemon 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">As a child, I've only watched all the episodes until the Johto League. After that I stopped continuing because it became a bit obvious that the main character would lose in the actual Pokemon tournament every time after collecting all the badges from each gyms. Anyhow, I found the first two seasons to be enjoyable when I first watched it and better than the seasons much later. Also the Team Rocket motto and them blasting off was memorable to hear throughout the entire series.</span>

     <p><br>The Spectacular Spider-Man (Sat. Morning Cartoon) 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I don't remember too about my experience watching this show. The only thing I can remember was that it used to air as a Saturday Morning cartoon on one of the channel which I don't remember back when I was a child.</span>

     <p><br>Back to the Future (franchise) 
      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I remember hearing about this great movie franchise when I was in middle school since it was mainly science fiction. After watching it, I found the second movie to be my favorite. This movie made me wish to have a time machine or a DeLorean so I can travel back to the past when I was a child to experience life before the first Iphone was invented. Right now, time machines don't exist yet and I hopw there will be one soon.</span>

     <p><br>Kirby Right Back At Ya (星のカービィ) 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I actually haven't watched this series as a child but as a high school student since I didn't know much about it. When I watched both the American and the Japanese version, I found the Japanese version to be better than the American version because of better actors and no plot moments were cut out. However, the American version had some plot moments cut out. I mainly watched it on Youtube during that time. Still I found this show good after watching the entire series.</span>

     <p><br>"Hi there! Face here."
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">"Hi there! Face here!". That one line was what made me remember watching this as a kid. I used to watch this right before a certain nick jr cartoon show would air or after it air such as for Blues Clues and etc. It's been a long time since I was a child that watch this. </span>

      <p><br>Arthur 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I loved this show since I was kid when watching it on PBS Kids. The reason was it taught a lot of life long lessons that I could utilize when I encountered a similar situation. I'm pretty much surprise that this show is still continuing to air more episodes assuming this show was a success. My favorite was the "Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn" which was from Season 1. I watched it as a child on PBS Kids. </span>

      <p><br>The Magic School Bus 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This series was also my absolute favorite for all the science fiction show mainly because I was interested more into science during that time. I can't imagine how great it was to see Ms. Frizzle be taking her class on a field trip to explore the aspects of Science through a school bus that can transform. I'm not a huge fan of the new Magic School Bus series because of the new animated graphics which is why I'm not watching it. Also the theme song for the opening  was really catchy for each episode.</span>

      <p><br>The Berenstain Bears 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This show was also my favorite since it offered life-long lessons similar to the Arthur show series. I also used to own the Berenstain Bear books when I was a kid before actually watching the series on the Internet. My favorite episode has to be when the bear family take a trip on a vacation.</span>

        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This is probably my favorite cartoon show that aired on nick jr back when I was a kid. Most of the games I'd played from nick jr were from this same cartoon series because they were fun and adventurous. I also liked the appearance, the voice, and the characteristics of Wubbzy which made me interested in this show. The opening theme song is really catchy so whoever created it, I give them confetti for making me addicted to this show as a kid. I actually never got the chance to finish the entire episode series for this show when I was a child. I might or might not plan to finish it since I have other stuff to do as an adult.</span>

      <p><br>Doug 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I didn't know about this show series until I was in fifth grade when our class decided to watch Doug during free time during that school year. A lot of characters and names are familar to me. I haven't watched the entire series because my class during that time only watched several of the season 1 episodes until the school year ended where I never got a chance to finish the entire series. Maybe I'll continue watching this 1990s cartoon series if I have time in life.</span>

      <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">I remember watching this show but I only saw the first few episodes using the VHS tape that I use to have as a child. The opening with Steve was pretty catchy. Same with the other guy that replaced Steve. Every time, I would end up thinking hard into what the actual answer would be after finding the clues that were marked with Blue's footprint. I heard the new Blue's Clues series got revived but the current series doesn't look the same as when it first came out</span>

      <p><br>Wheel of Fortune 
        <div class="tooltip">🛈<span class="tooltiptext">This game show is the show where I've been watching for quite a while ever since childhood. It's like a game of hangman except you miss the wheel for cash by guess a consonant in the letter board for cash. You can read more about its rules in detail if interested. I remember using this show as part of my advantage to learn English as a child since a lot of words were unfamiliar to me. I'm still surprise that the two host are still hosting the show today even though I was expecting them to retire soon. But at least it's better to keep the game show tradition going. One of my favorite thing about this game show is actually seeing contestants fail at guessing the correct puzzles.</span>
