I liked Plants vs Zombies 2 better than its predecessor mainly b/c you travel to different points in time dealing with different types of zombies.

        <div class="tooltip">ðŸ›ˆ<span class="tooltiptext">I used to play this game on my Ipad as a child when it was at the peak of popularity. I used to enjoy until I felt like it was getting boring playing the jelly, ingredient, move, and switch levels repetitively. Anyhow, puzzle games were pretty fun when I was playing this game. I've only played until World 11 which is Caramel Clearing which I stopped playing this game.</span>

Unfortunately I haven't a lot of board games like this for a while ever since I've own my first Iphone and laptop as an advantage of playing games that were available. Anyhow someday I'll play Connect 4 with opponents that dare to face me.</span>
