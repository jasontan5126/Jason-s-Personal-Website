        <p>HELLO WEBVIEWERS!!! Welcome to my first journal post that I've started my commitment to doing. I haven't written a journal ever since I was forced by my parents to write. I hope to continue following this tradition of mine as I get older. <br><br>
        As I see that tomorrow (July 3) is my 21st birthday, I considered it as my turning point in life in which I've crossed the boundry from being a teenager to an adult. One of the things I've been observing pretty closely in my last 21 years is the idea that life feels so different now compared to when I was a child. Let me ask you some of these following questions:  </p>   
          <ol><br>
            <li>Were there Iphones back when you guys were little (2000s)? <b></b></li>
            <li>What difference do you spot between what you've experienced during your childhood (2000s) vs now? <b></b></li>
            <li>Do you guys think the 2000s shows (The Golden Age of cartoons) are better than the ones right now?</li>
          </ol><br>
          <p>
            Because of that, I've started to gather everything I can remember over the past 21 years and place it in my webpage to ensure none of my memories is ever lost in time because we may never have the same cultural lifestyle we had before Iphone even existed. Lol!<br><br>
            Anyhow, just to conclude my first journal post, I will always continue to remember all the good old time we as individuals used to experienced before we even had Iphones. Which is why I wished that we had time machines so I can reexperience the good old times! That's it for now and hope you tune in as I start making new journal posts hopefully every week depending on how much free time I have.
