    <div class="myThought">
      <p>
        July is almost coming to the end and it's almost August. It feels like
        this summer is going by pretty fast now that at least 1 month of my
        summer internship has passed by pretty fast. Before even starting the
        summer internship, I found myself living in a dire situation because I
        was living in a time where I had nobody to interact with in person other
        than my family members. <br /><br />

        Until now, I felt overjoyed because of the idea that I've met a lot of
        new people who are mainly college students. Most of them were pretty
        nice. Plus they were all part of the same department that I was assigned
        to work for. We even sat together at a certain work table every Friday
        whenever it's our lunch break just so we can enjoy interacting with each
        other during our spare time. Not only that, I felt like I've changed
        ever since I first started the internship because I've learned a lot,
        learned to problem solve and rely on each other whenever we don't
        understand something to problem solve each other's problems.
        <br /><br />

        While I enjoyed the summer internship, Tuesday, there was actually a
        rare natural phenomenon that I got the chance to see with my own eyes.
        This happened when I was outdoors mainly because I was taking a walk
        enjoying my own relaxation of nature. During that time, the sky looked
        so smoky even though it looked like clouds. You couldn't even breath in
        it because that meant damaging my respiratory system. What was
        interesting that I got the chance to view with my own eyes was the "red
        sun" high in the sky. I thought, "How could the sun be red? It's not
        even close to sunset or sunrise. I should expect the color of the sun to
        be white". Until then, I found out that it's because of the wildfire
        smoke from the West Coast since I initially thought there was a volcano
        eruption going on. I may never see this natural phenomenon in a few
        years.<br /><br />

        Seeing a red sun plus doing my summer internship were my top moments
        this summer because it's not often that I get to experience these
        moments often in my life. Plus I'm hoping for good moments in the future
        which will bring better outcomes for me.
